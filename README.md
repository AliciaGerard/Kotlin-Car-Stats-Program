 This program allows the user to enter gas data to keep track of mileage for their vehicle 
 
  - It asks the user for three things
    - Gallons of gas pumped
    - The amount of miles currently on the car
    - How much the gas cost
 
  - It then displays the entry with a time stamp
  
  - The dots at the top right have an drop down menu with two options
    - A stats page which calculates all the entries the user has entered
    - A delete all option which deletes all the data entered
